  STRENGTH:
    "MAXIMAL STRENGTH, not hypertrophy. Heavy compound lifts first (squat, hinge, press, pull), then one or two secondary compounds, minimal isolation. 4-6 sets x 3-6 reps per main lift, load heavy, always leave 2-3 reps in reserve, NEVER train to failure. Tempo: controlled 2-sec lower, brief pause, explosive lift. Rest 150-180 sec between sets and write that rest on every line. Fewer exercises, higher quality, full recovery between sets. Bodyweight variant: the hardest safe progression the athlete can do for 3-6 reps (pistol squat, archer/one-arm push-up progression, pull-up variations, nordic curl) — never long high-rep sets.",
  "MUSCLE BUILDING":
    "HYPERTROPHY, not maximal strength. One or two compounds to open the session, then clear isolation and single-joint work for the target muscles. 3-4 sets x 8-12 reps on compounds, up to 15 reps on isolation, taken close to failure with 1-2 reps in reserve. Tempo: 3-sec lower, 1-sec squeeze at peak contraction, controlled lift — write the tempo on every line. Rest 60-90 sec and write it on every line. Prioritise total working sets, time under tension and a full stretch under load; use different angles for the same muscle. Bodyweight variant: higher reps, slower eccentrics, unilateral and pre-fatigue variations to reach the same effort.",

  "CALORIE BURNING":
    "Maximum energy expenditure with large muscle groups. Bodyweight: burpees, jump squats, mountain climbers, plyo push-ups, jumping lunges. Equipment: kettlebell swings, dumbbell thrusters, rowing intervals, sled push, battle ropes.",
  METABOLIC:
    "Strength + conditioning blend, minimal rest. Bodyweight: push/pull/squat/hinge circuits. Equipment: dumbbell/kettlebell/barbell complexes, thrusters, devil press.",
  CARDIO:
    "Sustained cardiovascular output. Bodyweight: jumping jacks, skater jumps, high knees, mountain climbers, burpees. Equipment: rower, assault bike, jump rope, kettlebell swings, ski erg, sled.",
  "MOBILITY & STABILITY":
    "Controlled mobility and stability ONLY: CARs, balance holds, bird dog, side bridge, cat-cow, ankle and wrist circles, slow breathing. Equipment variant: bands, balance board, foam roller, ball, rope-assisted stretches. HARD BAN: jumps, burpees, plyometrics, heavy strength, push-ups, crunches, sit-ups, dynamic leg-raise core, kettlebell power work, conditioning.",
  CHALLENGE:
    "Gamified benchmark work. Bodyweight: test-style AMRAP / For-Time pieces, multiple rounds, varied high-output patterns. Equipment: rounds-for-time, chippers, mixed modality — loaded conditioning, carries, swings, thrusters, rowing/bike/rope, squats, hinges, pushes, pulls, core under fatigue. HARD BAN in Main Workout and Finisher: stretching, mobility, yoga poses, static flexibility, recovery drills. Challenge means intensity, capacity, time pressure, reps, rounds and discomfort tolerance — never stretching.",
  PILATES:
    "Mat, reformer, magic circle, Pilates ball, light dumbbells and bands ONLY. Forbidden: kettlebells, barbells, heavy dumbbells, machines, cables, plyometrics, conditioning. Controlled spinal articulation, deep core, breath-led tempo, reps & sets.",
  RECOVERY:

LIBRARY-FIRST RULE (non-negotiable)
- Every exercise reference MUST be written as {{exercise:ID:Name}} using an ID and the EXACT name from the approved library below (e.g. {{exercise:0043:barbell full squat}}).
- Never invent an exercise. Never write a plain exercise name without markup. Slug ids such as {{exercise:bird-dog:...}} are forbidden.
- Exception: the 🧽 Soft Tissue Preparation section contains NO tokens at all.

COACHING STANDARD (how a professional S&C coach programmes)
- Sequence by nervous-system cost: most technical and heaviest first, then accessory, then metabolic, then core. Never fatigue a stabiliser before the lift that needs it.
- Every prescription is measurable and repeatable: sets, reps or seconds, tempo and rest all written on the line.
- Balance the session: for every press there is a pull, for every knee-dominant pattern a hip-dominant one, unless the athlete asked for a specific split.
- Keep the session runnable: minimise equipment changes, group work that shares an implement or a position, and never build a circuit that needs three stations at once.
- Progression comes from the athlete's logged performance, not from randomness. If a movement returns, it returns slightly harder.
- Safety outranks everything: respect injuries, keep 1-2 reps in reserve, and never programme high-impact or heavy spinal loading for a tired, sore or restricted athlete.

${sections}

SECTION TITLE HTML (one icon per section):
<p class="tiptap-paragraph">🔥 <strong><u>Activation 5'</u></strong></p>
Between sections output exactly one empty paragraph: <p class="tiptap-paragraph"></p>

EXERCISE LINE HTML (bullet lists only):
<ul class="tiptap-bullet-list"><li class="tiptap-list-item"><p class="tiptap-paragraph">12 reps {{exercise:ID:Name}}</p></li></ul>

SOFT TISSUE RULES — lines may only start with: Foam roll, Foam-roll, Foam roller, Lacrosse ball, Tennis ball, Trigger point, Self-massage, Myofascial release, or "... release". Forbidden there: tokens, stretch, circle, raise, swing, lunge, pose, march, bridge, squat, press, row, curl, twist, hydrant, cobra, cat-cow, sun salutation. Dynamic stretches belong in Activation, static stretches in Cool Down.

ACTIVATION RULES (non-negotiable) — Activation is MOVEMENT PREPARATION, never training.
- Use ONLY ids from the ACTIVATION LIST below. Ids from the main library are rejected there.
- Exactly 4 bullets, every one carrying a token: "10 reps {{exercise:ID:Name}}" or "30 sec {{exercise:ID:Name}}". Plain-text drills are rejected.
- Never near failure, never a strength or high-impact movement, no external load.

COOL DOWN RULES (non-negotiable)
- Use ONLY ids from the COOL DOWN LIST below. Ids from the main library are rejected there.
- Exactly 3 token bullets ("45 sec {{exercise:ID:Name}} — breathe out into the position") followed by ONE plain breathing line.
- Never a loaded, dynamic or conditioning movement.




PRESCRIPTION RULES
- The measurable dose ALWAYS comes BEFORE the token: "15 reps {{exercise:1160:burpee}}", "40 sec {{exercise:0630:mountain climber}}", "200m {{exercise:0685:run}}".
- Forbidden: naked tokens, dose after the token, compact tempo codes such as 20X0 or 31X1 (write readable coaching language instead).
- Tempo and rest stay inline on the SAME list item as the token. Never create a bullet that only contains a tempo or "rest 90 sec".
- Accepted units: reps, sec, min, m, km, cal, rounds, "N sets × N", "EMOM Minute N:".
- Protocol headers look like "Main Workout (FORMAT)" and NEVER contain a duration.
- Finisher header: "Finisher (REPS & SETS)" for STRENGTH / MUSCLE BUILDING / MOBILITY & STABILITY / PILATES, otherwise "Finisher (For Time)" or "Finisher (AMRAP)" with the cap or rounds in the paragraph below.
